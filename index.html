    At the most basic level, the user interface (UI) is the series of screens, pages, and visual elements—like buttons and icons—that enable a person to interact with a product or service.
User experience (UX), on the other hand, is the internal experience that a person has as they interact with every aspect of a company’s products and services.
It’s common for folks to use these terms interchangeably, or sometimes incorrectly. If you’ve ever wondered, “What is UI, what is UX, and what’s the difference between them?” today we’ll dig a bit deeper into UI and UX to get a better understanding of the differences between them.</p>

    The Russo-Ukrainian War[e] is an ongoing international conflict between Russia, alongside Russian-backed separatists, and Ukraine, which began in February 2014.[f] Following Ukraine's Revolution of Dignity, Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine and supported pro-Russian separatists fighting the Ukrainian military in the Donbas war. The first eight years of conflict also included naval incidents, cyberwarfare, and heightened political tensions. In February 2022, Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine.
In early 2014, the Euromaidan protests led to the Revolution of Dignity and the ousting of Ukraine's pro-Russian president Viktor Yanukovych. Shortly after, pro-Russian unrest erupted in eastern and southern Ukraine. Simultaneously, unmarked Russian troops moved into Ukraine's Crimea and took over government buildings, strategic sites and infrastructure. Russia soon annexed Crimea after a highly-disputed referendum. In April 2014, armed pro-Russian separatists seized government

        While some designers choose to join a UI/UX design course or a bootcamp program, a lot of phenomenal UI/UX designers are self-taught, at least in the beginning. So how do you go about teaching yourself to design beautiful digital products?

There are a number of paths to learning UI/UX design and there’s not really a single right or wrong way. It all comes down to learning the theories behind good design and practicing them until you master them.

In this article, we’ll take you through the 6 steps you need to become a self-taught UI/UX designer in 2023:

Step 1: Learn the fundamentals of UX design
Step 2: Develop an eye for good design
Step 3: Invest in the right design software
Step 4: Build a portfolio of work
Step 5: Ask for feedback (and learn from it)
Step 6: Get real-world work experience

Hear the term artificial intelligence (AI) and you might think of self-driving cars, robots, ChatGPT or other AI chatbots, and artificially created images. But it's also important to look behind the outputs of AI and understand how the technology works and its impacts for this and future generations.
AI is a concept that has been around, formally, since the 1950s.

US President Joe Biden’s warning the US would defend Taiwan against Chinese aggression has made headlines around the world – and put growing tensions between the small democratic island and its neighboring autocratic superpower back under the spotlight.
    Less than a decade ago, ties seemed to be on the mend as the two sides – separated by a strait that is fewer than 80 miles (128 kilometers) wide at its narrowest point – deepened economic, cultural and even political engagements. But today, relations are at their lowest point in decades – raising fears of military escalation, even as experts caution that an imminent all-out war remains unlikely.

    Artificial intelligence (AI) is a wide-ranging tool that enables people to rethink how we integrate information, analyze data, and use the resulting insights to improve decision making—and already it is transforming every walk of life. In this report, Darrell West and John Allen discuss AI’s application across a variety of sectors, address issues in its development, and offer recommendations for getting the most out of AI while still protecting important human values.

  <p class="post-description">
    Until a few years ago, the term “Indo-Pacific” was hardly uttered in international affairs. Now many countries have adopted so-called Indo-Pacific strategies, including America, Australia, Britain, France, India, Indonesia, Japan, the Philippines and even Mongolia. South Korea joined the pack in December. The main Asian holdout is China, which scorns the phrase. That is key to understanding what the Indo-Pacific is all about.
